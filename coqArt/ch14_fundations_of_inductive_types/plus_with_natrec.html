<h1>  A direct definition of addition   </h1>

Give another definition of addition on <tt>nat</tt>, without using
<tt>Fixpoint</tt> nor <tt>fix</tt>, but as an application of
<tt>nat_rec</tt>. <br>
Is your definition equivalent to <em>Coq</em>'s <tt>plus</tt> ?


<h2>Solution</h2>

Look at <a href="SRC/plus_with_natrec.v"> this file </a>
