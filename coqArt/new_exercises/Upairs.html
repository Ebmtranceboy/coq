<h1>  Equality on unordered pairs </h1>

Let <tt>t:Type</tt>  be a type with an equivalence relation 
<tt>eq:t->t->Prop</tt>. We can represent unordered pairs of elements of
<t> as elements of the cartesian product <tt>t*t</tt>, considering
the pairs <tt>(x,y)</tt> and <tt>(y,x)</tt> as equivalent.
<br>
Moreover, if <tt>eq</tt> is decidable, the equivalence on <tt>t*t</tt> induced 
induced  by  <tt>eq</tt> and satisfying the property above is decidable too.
<br>
Express this construction by a functor taking as argument an arbitrary module
<tt>M:DecidableType</tt> (see Coq's standard library).
