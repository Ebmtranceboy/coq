<h1> On the danger of evaluation </h1>

First define on <tt>nat</tt> the exponential towers of base 2 and heigth 
<em>n</em>.
For instance the tower of height 4 is 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup></sup>
=16384.
<ol>
<li> Consider the following definition of even natural numbers:
<pre>
Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
  even0 : even 0
| even_S : forall p, even p -> even (S (S p)).

Hint Constructors even.
</pre>
Prove that the tower of height 6 is an even number, 
and let us call your theorem <tt>six_tower</tt>. 
<li> 
Try the command <tt> Compute six_tower </tt>
<li>
Make the constant <tt>six_tower</tt> transparent (by replacing
its <tt>Qed</tt> with <tt>Defined</tt>), and redo the preceding question.
<li>
I presume that your proof of <tt>six_tower</tt> uses some lemmas.
Edit your proof and replace their <tt>Qed</tt> with <tt>Defined</tt>.
What happens?
