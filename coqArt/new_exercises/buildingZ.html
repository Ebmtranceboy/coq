<h1> Setoids for beginners </h1>

Although the type <b>Z</b> of integers is already defined in Coq, it
is interesting to look at the usual mathematical building of the set of
integers as a quotient of the set of pairs of natural numbers by the
 equivalence relation <em>(a,b) R (c,d)</em> if <em>a+d = b+c</em>.
<br>
In Coq, you will associate a setoid to this equivalence relation, and
register the usual operations : <b>+</b>, <b>*</b>, etc, as morphisms.
Prove also that you build a ring with unity and the property of integrity
(<em>i.e.</em> if <em>xy = 0 </em> then <em>x = 0 </em> or
<em>y = 0 </em>.)<br>

In a second time, build the ring of integers modulo p (with p:nat).
<br>
Give some examples of <tt>setoid_replace</tt> and <tt>setoid_rewrite</tt>.
