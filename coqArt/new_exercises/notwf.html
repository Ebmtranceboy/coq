<h1> On Well Founded sets and the Axiom of Choice </h1>

Prove that, if we admit the axiom of functional choice
(look at library <tt>Logic.ClassicalChoice</tt>),
then if some relation R is not well founded, there exists a 
strictly decreasing (w.r.t. R) infinite sequence.



<h2> Remarks </h2>

Look also at <a href="../gen-rec/not-decreasing.html"> that exercise </a>
<br>
The Axiom of Functional Choice is presented on  Coq's FAQ 
(in <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/doc-eng.html"> Coq's documentation </a>).
Look at the section "The Logic of Coq : Axioms".
