<h1> Equivalence between two definitions of permutations of lists </h1>


Among many ways to define  permutations between lists (please have a look at Standard Library !),
consider the following ones:
<ul>
<li> Comparing the number of occurrences of items in both lists
<li> Using an inductive definition 
<pre>
Inductive permI  :list A ->list A ->Prop:=
|permI_refl:forall l, permI l l
|permI_cons:forall a l0 l1, permI l0 l1-> permI (a::l0)(a::l1)
|permI_app:forall a l, permI (a::l) (l++(a::nil))
|permI_trans:forall l1 l2 l3,
              permI l1 l2 -> permI l2 l3 -> permI l1 l3.

</pre>
</ul>

Show that both definitions are logically equivalent.

<br>

Use this equivalence to prove easily the following fact:
<pre>
Lemma counterexample : ~ permI (2::3::5::5::8::7::4::nil) 
                               (3::2::8::7::4::3::5::nil).
</pre>
