<h1> On palindromes </h1>

Défine the inductive predicate <tt>palindrome</tt>
associated to lists that can be read the same way in both directions.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Look at <a href="SRC/palindrome.v">this file </a>.

<h3> Note </h3>
We added to the end of this file a proof that a list is
palindromic (according to the inductive definition) if and only if
it is equal to its own reverse (defined by the function <tt>rev</tt> in
<tt>PolyList</tt>).
<br><br>
This proof is quite interesting, because we needed to build some tools to
achieve it :

<ul>
<li> In order to prove that  <tt>(palindromic l)</tt> implies
<tt>(rev l)=l</tt>, we had to prove an inversion theorem about the
extraction of the last element of a list (lemma <tt>remove_last_inv</tt>)
and a commutation lemma between <tt>app</tt> and <tt>rev</tt>.

<li> The proof of the converse was quite harder, since palindromes are
built by adding items at both ends of a list, and the lisp-like definition
of lists considers only insertion at the beginning (constructor <tt>cons</tt>).
<br>
The way we proceeded was to prove first an induction principle for lists,
considering insertions at both ends :
<pre>
Lemma list_new_ind :
 forall P:list A -> Prop,
   P nil ->
   (forall a:A, P (a :: nil)) ->
   (forall (a b:A) (l:list A), P l -> P (a :: l ++ b :: nil)) ->
   forall l:list A, P l.
</pre>
The proof of this induction principle  uses the "Fibonacci induction scheme" :
<pre>
Lemma fib_ind :
 forall P:nat -> Prop,
   P 0 ->
   P 1 -> 
  (forall n:nat, P n -> P (S n) -> P (S (S n))) -> 
  forall n:nat, P n.
</pre>

<li> Finally, we proved two lemmas of regularity of <tt>app</tt>

<pre>
Lemma app_left_reg : forall l l1 l2:list A, l ++ l1 = l ++ l2 -> l1 = l2.

Lemma app_right_reg : forall l l1 l2:list A, l1 ++ l = l2 ++ l -> l1 = l2.
</pre>
The first lemma is proved by a simple induction on
<tt>l</tt>, the second one comes directly <em>via</em> properties of
the <tt>rev</tt> function (taken from <tt>PolyList</tt>).
 A direct proof by induction  both on <tt>l1</tt> and
<tt>l2</tt> would have been too long.
</ul>
