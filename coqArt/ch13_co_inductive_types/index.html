<h1> Infinite Objects and Proofs </h1>

<h2> Potentially infinite lists </h2>

The chapter on co-inductive types of our book 
is mainly illustrated with the theory of finite or infinite ("lazy") lists.
<a href="SRC/Coinduc.v"> This file </a> contains the complete development
of this theory.
Please notice that most of exercises proposed in the book are solved
in <a href="SRC/chap13.v"> this file </a>, presented as a complete Coq
development.



<br>
Here are some more exercises on this topic.

<h2> Lazy binary trees </h2>
All the technology illustrated by linear lists apply to
tree structures. The following thread of exercises is devoted to
binary trees which may have infinite branches.

<h2> Further Reading </h2>

Yves Bertot, then Yves Bertot and Ekaterina Komendantskaya published two papers
for solving the filter issue on infinite lists. The first paper shows how 
to define the stream of prime numbers using Erathsthenes's sieve.
The second paper presents  a generalization of the employed techniques.
<br>
Both papers show how to mix inductive and co-inductive techniques. They also
use sophisticated techniques of dependent elimination.
